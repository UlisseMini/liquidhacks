# liquidhacks

liquify api credits from hackathons to cash.

## Spec

Core platform:

A web platform people can buy/sell API credits from others, won from hackathons. We're a chat platform initially for the mvp. no stripe, just connect buyers with sellers and facilitate trust. People post the credits/thing they have, with associated devpost/github link/contact for trust. Then people can message them. We literally just CRUD this with logins as the initial super MVP thing. Just connecting people.

Additional features:

- Automated agentic reachout for growth. Find hackathon winners by monitoring devpost, and then attempt to reach out in an automated way after finding their contacts. Can start by just creating a big spreadsheet for manual reachout.
